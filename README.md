# TransZero
This code builds on the original [muzero-general implementation](https://github.com/werner-duvaud/muzero-general) and was used in our work on **[Parallel Tree Expansion in MuZero using Transformer Networks](https://repository.tudelft.nl/record/uuid:00d171fe-328e-4c78-a981-050e08c2ba08)** (see also the [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11233)).


## How to Run

You can run the code in two ways:

* **Kaggle Notebook:**
  [Run on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/emilmalmsten/transzero/)

* **Local Script:**
  Run from the terminal using:

  ```bash
  bash scripts/rp_utils/rp_run.sh
  ```

Note that the code needs some cleaning up and commenting, this will be done during September.
